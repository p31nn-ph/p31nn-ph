# Hi, I’m Peam

Pharmacy student developing expertise in computational modeling for biomedical and drug-related problems.

My training in pharmaceutical sciences provides biological and clinical context. I am building the computational side through structured, project-based work focused on turning data into decision-support models.

This GitHub documents that transition.

## Current Focus

I am learning to design complete modeling workflows:
•	Handling structured scientific/clinical-style datasets
•	Data preprocessing and feature engineering
•	Building baseline machine learning models
•	Evaluating performance and limitations
•	Organizing reproducible research-style projects

Each repository represents one step in improving these capabilities.

## Long-Term Direction

My goal is to work at the intersection of:
•	Drug science and pharmacological systems
•	Predictive modeling
•	Data-driven decision systems in healthcare

I am particularly interested in how modeling evolves from:

statistical methods → machine learning → mechanistic / physics-informed approaches

## Tools I’m Currently Developing

Stack
•	Python
•	NumPy, Pandas
•	Data visualization
•	scikit-learn (foundational level)
•	Git and structured project organization

## How to Read My Repositories

Projects follow a consistent structure:

Problem → Data → Model → Evaluation → Reflection

They show:
•	The problem being modeled
•	The modeling approach taken
•	Results and limitations
•	What was learned and improved
